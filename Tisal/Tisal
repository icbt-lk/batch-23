# This is just random
# I have succesfully setup VSCode to work with Git and can now use it better
# All the commands that I could want are present here
# Now its getting kinda fun
# I struggled to get this working properly
# Problem was....
# I hadn't setup 'user.name' and 'user.email'
# Now that I got that working, everything is smooth
